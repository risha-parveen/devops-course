IP address: The IP address between the containers and the host machine is different. They have different networking environments and 
so, a bridge network is used for containers to communicate with each other and also the host.

list of running processes: containers only consists of the processes that are running inside them. It does not have information about
processes running on the host or other containers. Therefore, the list of processes are shorter when ran in docker compared to host machine.
I also noticed that the host machine is aware of the processes taking placing in the containers.

file system: In this exercise, since there was no volumes mounted containers only had the files related to its specific execution.

uptime: since the containers were started at different timings the results for this parameter were different for service 1 and 2.
This time is specific to the containers showing the time since last boot. Containers are isolated environments, and they donâ€™t share the system clock or processes
with each other or the host machine.
